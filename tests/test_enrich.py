Test module for the enrich functionality.

This module contains unit tests for the Enricher class and its methods.
Tests are designed to work with mocked API calls for CI/CD environments.

    Test the enrich method with dummy data.

        Uncomment the actual API call lines when running locally with valid API keys.
